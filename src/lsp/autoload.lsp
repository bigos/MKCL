MKCL specific.
Prints the documentation associated with SYMBOL.  With no args, it prints this
greeting message to MKCL beginners:

Welcome to MKCL. Here are the few functions you should learn first.

	(MKCL:HELP symbol) prints the online documentation associated with the
	symbol.  For example, (HELP 'CONS) will print the useful information
	about the CONS function, the CONS data type, and so on.

	(MKCL:HELP* string) prints the online documentation associated with those
	symbols whose print-names have the string as substring.  For example,
	(HELP* \"PROG\") will print the documentation of the symbols such as
	PROG, PROGN, and MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1.

	(MKCL:QUIT) ends the current MKCL session.
