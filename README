MKCL

* Building

  On a relatively fresh Linux this should do:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    cd mkcl
    ./configure
    make
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies

  MKCL requires the platform supplied GMP library (>= 4.3.2), and GMP
  development files when compiling MKCL from its sources.

  On Debian based systems you can install it using:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
#+END_SRC

* Installing

  You can "install" MKCL locally into the source directory by:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    cd mkcl/src
    make install-local
#+END_SRC

  Once it's done you can use the ./mkcl/src/bin/mkcl executable to
  start MKCL, either directly or through a symlink. You may want to
  use 'rlwrap mkcl' to enable line editing.

  If you so prefer then you can install MKCL using 'make install'
  under the filesystem prefix given to the configure script (it
  defaults to '/usr/local').
