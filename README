* MKCL

** Building

On a relatively fresh Linux this should do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  cd MKCL
  ./configure
  make
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Dependencies

   MKCL requires the platform supplied GMP library (>= 4.3.2), and GMP
   development files when compiling MKCL from its sources.

   On Debian based systems you can install it using:

 #+BEGIN_SRC
     sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
 #+END_SRC

** Installing

You can "install" MKCL locally into the source directory by:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  cd MKCL/src
  make install-local
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once it's done you can use the ./MKCL/src/bin/mkcl executable to
start MKCL, either directly or through a symlink. You may want to
use 'rlwrap mkcl' to enable line editing.

If you so prefer then you can install MKCL using
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  make install
#+END_EXAMPLE
under the filesystem prefix given to the configure script (it
defaults to '/usr/local/bin').
