# make all	to compile and build Emacs.

# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
# 
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
# 
# make realclean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean.

# ==================== Cleaning up and miscellanea ====================

#   `clean'
#        Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#        created by building the program.  Don't delete the files that
#        record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made

#        with them.

clean:
	cd src; $(MAKE) clean

#   `distclean'
#        Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#        configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#        source and built the program without creating any other files,
#        `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#        distribution.

distclean: clean

	$(RM) Makefile

#   `realclean'
#        Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#        reconstructed with 'configure' and this Makefile.in.
#        One exception, however: `make realclean' should not delete
#        `configure' even if `configure' can be remade using a rule in the
#        Makefile.  More generally, `make realclean' should not delete
#        anything that needs to exist in order to run `configure' and then
#        begin to build the program.
